# ‚öíÔ∏è What I've been working on: ‚öíÔ∏è
<br/>
## Data Visualization 
<br/>
![Tableau](img/Tableau.png)
<br/>
Tableau is my go-to tool for [data visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aedeguzman/vizzes). It starts with importing data from various sources, such as spreadsheets, databases, or cloud services. Once the data is in, Tableau's user-friendly interface allows me to effortlessly create interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards. I can customize these visuals to tell a compelling data story, adjusting colors, labels, and interactivity to highlight key insights. Tableau's real-time data exploration features enable me to dive deep into the details or zoom out for a broader view, making it an indispensable tool for data analysis and reporting. Whether it's for business presentations, analytics, or uncovering trends, Tableau helps me unlock the power of data through visual representation.

## VADER Sentiment Analysis
<br/>
![Smiling face Emoji](img/emoji-7103761_640.png)

Employing [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/09b4b1ac90f05597b419e31bda490f8481787470/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)on Amazon Fine Foods reviews provided a valuable means to gauge customer sentiments with precision. By utilizing this tool, I was able to quantitatively assess the polarity of reviews, distinguishing between positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. This analysis allowed me to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for product improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the Amazon Fine Foods product line.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
<br/>

![Roller Coaster](img/kings-island-211994_640.jpg)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) played a pivotal role in uncovering valuable insights within the  [Roller Coaster Database](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/ffdbb82542040c1322ff0f38ccce84afb0a73b0c/Roller%20Coaster%20EDA.ipynb).  By visualizing and summarizing the dataset's key attributes, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how many roller coasters were built in which year,  as well as the materials the roller coaster were comprised of.  I also examined the relationships between the height of the coaster and its maximum speed.  EDA allowed us to identify trends, correlations, and outliers, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize ride experiences, and marketing strategies within the amusement park industry.
