# ⚒️ What I've been working on: ⚒️
<br/>
## VADER Sentiment Analysis
<br/>
![Smiling face Emoji](img/emoji-7103761_640.png)

I used [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/09b4b1ac90f05597b419e31bda490f8481787470/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb) to analyze reviews from Amazon Fine Foods.  In this project, I looked at the relationship between the reviews given, and their star rating.  I  analyzed its sentiment to see if there was any correlation between a low star rating, and a bad review as well as a high star rating and a good review.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
<br/>

![Roller Coaster](img/kings-island-211994_640.jpg)

I performed Exploratory Data Analysis using the [Roller Coaster Database](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/ffdbb82542040c1322ff0f38ccce84afb0a73b0c/Roller%20Coaster%20EDA.ipynb).  For this project I looked at trends regarding how many roller coasters were built in wht year,  as well as the materials the roller coaster were comprised of.  I also examined the relationships between the height of the coaster and its maximum speed.
