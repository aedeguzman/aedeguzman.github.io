## VADER Sentiment Analysis
<br/>
![Smiling face Emoji](img/emoji-7103761_640.png)

Employing [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/09b4b1ac90f05597b419e31bda490f8481787470/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb) on Amazon Fine Foods reviews provided a valuable means to gauge customer sentiments with precision. By utilizing this tool, I was able to quantitatively assess the polarity of reviews, distinguishing between positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. This analysis allowed me to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for product improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the Amazon Fine Foods product line.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
<br/>

![Roller Coaster](img/kings-island-211994_640.jpg)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) played a pivotal role in uncovering valuable insights within the  [Roller Coaster Database](https://github.com/aedeguzman/aedeguzman.github.io/blob/ffdbb82542040c1322ff0f38ccce84afb0a73b0c/Roller%20Coaster%20EDA.ipynb).  By visualizing and summarizing the dataset's key attributes, I gained a comprehensive understanding of how many roller coasters were built in which year,  as well as the materials the roller coaster were comprised of.  I also examined the relationships between the height of the coaster and its maximum speed.  EDA allowed us to identify trends, correlations, and outliers, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize ride experiences, and marketing strategies within the amusement park industry.
